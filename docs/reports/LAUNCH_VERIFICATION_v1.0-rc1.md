# TRDR Hub v1.0-RC1 Deployment Verification Report

## Overview
- **Generated:** 2025-10-30T15:??Z *(local system clock: unavailable timezone specifics)*  
- **Requested Release:** v1.0-rc1  
- **Overall Status:** ⚠️ Blocked — prerequisites unmet; deployment not executed.

## Environment & Config Readiness
- `.env.production`: ❌ Not found in repository; cannot confirm required secret values (JWT_SECRET_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID, FRONTEND_URL, API_BASE_URL, DR_OBJECT_BACKUP_BUCKET).
- `render.yaml`: ⚠️ Present but commands differ from requested spec (`pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt` & `uvicorn main:app ...`).
- `vercel.json`: ⚠️ Present but uses legacy build pipeline (custom `buildCommand`, no `env` mapping, no catch-all route format requested).

## Pre-Deployment Validation
| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python -m pytest -q` | ❌ | Fails during collection: missing packages (`moto`, `structlog`, `werkzeug`, `openpyxl`, etc.) and invalid module references; Python 3.13 environment lacks required wheels (e.g., `psycopg2-binary`). |
| `python -m alembic upgrade head` | ❌ | Aborted: `ModuleNotFoundError` for `pydantic_settings` while loading Alembic env. |
| `npm run build` (apps/web) | ✅ | Vite build completed; emitted size warning (>500 kB chunk) but build succeeded. |

## Deployment Attempts
| Target | Command | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Render backend | `render deploy --service trdrhub-api --branch main` | ❌ Not run — Render CLI absent on host and no API token configured. |
| Vercel frontend | `vercel --prod` | ⚠️ Not run — CLI installed but requires interactive login; credentials not available. |

## Live Smoke Tests
- Backend health (`/health/live`), AI test, upload HEAD: ❌ Not executed (no deployment).
- Frontend Playwright smoke suite: ❌ Not executed (no deployed build to validate).

## Post-Deployment Checks
- CloudWatch logs / alarms: ❌ Cannot run — AWS CLI missing.
- Database sanity (`psql` via `render ssh`): ❌ Render tooling unavailable.
- Alembic head snapshot: ❌ Blocked pending successful migration run.

## Outstanding Blockers
1. Install backend dependencies compatible with Python 3.11/3.12 or provision Python 3.12 runtime plus `pip install -r apps/api/requirements.txt` (fails under 3.13 because `psycopg2-binary` wheel unavailable).  
2. Provide `.env.production` populated with required secrets before deploy.  
3. Update `render.yaml` to requested Gunicorn/Uvicorn worker configuration, then install Render CLI (`npm install -g render-cli` or similar) and authenticate.  
4. Align `vercel.json` with desired static-build setup and log into Vercel CLI.  
5. After dependencies resolved, re-run pytest, alembic migrations, and Playwright smoke tests.  
6. Configure AWS CLI credentials to execute post-deployment log/metric checks.

## Recommendation
Deployment remains **blocked** pending remediation of the above prerequisites. Re-run the verification checklist after environment preparation to achieve a ✅ “GO LIVE — Production Ready” status.
