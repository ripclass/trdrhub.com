Project Brief: LCopilot
Executive Summary
LCopilot is an AI-powered assistant that helps Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) exporters and importers in Bangladesh validate Letters of Credit (LCs) with speed and confidence. Today, SMEs lose money and time due to LC errors that cause bank rejections, shipment delays, and demurrage fees. LCopilot eliminates this risk by combining OCR, rules-based checks, and AI analysis to instantly flag discrepancies against UCP 600 standards. The result is a clear, bank-ready discrepancy report that transforms the SME’s experience from uncertainty and fear to clarity, control, and faster payments.

Problem Statement
The Current State: High Stakes, Manual Processes
For Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) exporters in Bangladesh, every shipment is a high-stakes event where cash flow is tied to perfect paperwork. The current process for validating a Letter of Credit (LC) is manual, fragmented, and fraught with anxiety. SMEs rely on a combination of self-checks by non-expert staff, expensive third-party consultants, or a slow feedback loop from their bank—often discovering critical errors only after documents have been submitted and rejected. This creates a state of persistent uncertainty and operational friction.
“On my last shipment,” says a Chittagong-based exporter of frozen seafood, “the bank found a mismatch between the invoice and the LC for the port name. It delayed my payment for 19 days. Every day my container sat at the port, I was paying demurrage. By the time I got paid, I had lost half the profit.”
Quantifiable Impact: A Drain on SME Resources
A single discrepancy in an LC presentation is enough for a bank to refuse payment, triggering a cascade of direct and indirect costs that disproportionately harm SMEs:
Payment Delays: Cash flow, the lifeblood of an SME, is frozen for days or weeks.
Direct Fees: Banks charge significant fees for handling discrepancies and re-presenting documents.
Demurrage & Storage Costs: Delays at the port result in daily fees that erode profit margins.
Reputational Damage: Failed presentations damage trust with international buyers and financial institutions.
Why Existing Solutions Fail
Current workarounds are inadequate for the SME segment:
Manual Checklists: Prone to human error and unable to handle the complexity of cross-document consistency checks required by UCP 600/ISBP standards.
Consultants & Agents: Expensive, dependency-creating, and not available on-demand for the instant feedback modern trade requires.
Bank Pre-Checks: Slow, not guaranteed, and position the bank as an auditor rather than a partner.
The Urgency for SMEs
In a competitive global market, the speed and reliability of payment cycles are a significant competitive advantage. The manual process is a major bottleneck that stifles growth, introduces unnecessary financial risk, and consumes valuable time that SME owners should be spending on expanding their business, not firefighting paperwork.

Proposed Solution
The MVP: A Focused "Shield" for Day 1
The LCopilot MVP is a SaaS-based AI assistant designed to provide immediate, tangible risk reduction for SMEs. By simply uploading their documents, users receive an instant validation report flagging the most common and costly discrepancies before submission to the bank. The essential features for Day 1 are:
Upload & OCR: Accept an LC plus 1–2 key documents (Invoice, Bill of Lading).
Rules-First Checks (Core Set): Focus on the “fatal four” discrepancies: Dates, amounts, parties, and ports.
Simple Cross-Check Matrix (v1): Provide a side-by-side field comparison of the core documents.
Bank-Ready Report (v1): Generate a clear discrepancy summary, checklist, and deadline tracker as a downloadable PDF.
The Long-Term Vision
The long-term vision is for LCopilot to evolve from a defensive "shield" into a proactive "sword" for SMEs. It will become a holistic trade confidence platform that not only prevents errors but actively helps users optimize their trade cycles. The goal is to make LCopilot the indispensable digital co-pilot for every SME in Bangladesh engaged in international trade, making compliance a source of competitive advantage.

Target Users
Primary User Segment: The Bangladeshi SME Exporter/Importer
Our primary user is the owner or operations manager of an SME in Bangladesh's export/import sector (e.g., garments, seafood, jute).
Profile: Typically employs 20-200 people and lacks a dedicated trade finance or legal department. LC validation is a high-stress, manual task handled by non-specialists.
Needs & Pains: Their core need is certainty. Their primary pains are the fear of rejection, the financial hit from fees and delays, and a feeling of being powerless against complex rules.
Goals: To get paid quickly and predictably (exporters) and ensure terms are correct from the start to avoid amendments (importers).
User Journeys (Before vs. After)
Exporter's Journey: Transforms from a multi-day, high-anxiety process of manual checks and waiting for bank feedback into a 15-minute, high-confidence process of uploading, fixing flagged issues, and submitting a compliant report.
Importer's Journey: Transforms from a reactive process of discovering problematic LC terms after issuance (leading to costly amendments and supplier friction) into a proactive one of validating draft LCs before they are finalized, ensuring smoother transactions.
Note: The MVP is optimized to solve the primary pain points of exporters. While importers will find value in the core checks, full feature support for the importer journey is planned for a post-MVP release.

Goals & Success Metrics
Business Objectives
Launch MVP: Launch the LCopilot MVP within 8-10 weeks to validate core product assumptions.
Validate Business Model: Test SME willingness-to-pay by converting a target percentage of free-trial users to a paid plan.
Achieve Market Traction: Onboard an initial cohort of SMEs to generate usage data and testimonials.
User Success Metrics
Time-to-Confidence: A drastic reduction in the time it takes a user to validate an LC (from hours/days to minutes).
Reduced Rejection Rate: A measurable decrease in first-presentation document rejections, as reported by pilot users.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Activation Rate: Number of users who complete their first free LC check.
Conversion Rate: % of activated users who purchase a second check or a monthly pack.
Core Engine Accuracy: Achieve a target precision/recall score on our internal "Accuracy Harness."
Counter-Metrics (Early Warning Signals)
High Drop-off After Upload: Users upload but don't generate a report (signals UX friction or lack of trust).
Low Second-Use Rate: High percentage of users only use the free trial (signals low perceived value).
High Support Dependency: High volume of "What does this mean?" tickets (signals report is not clear enough).

MVP Scope

Importer-Focused Features: Build out checks for Incoterms and other clauses critical to the importer journey, doubling the addressable market.
Advisory Layer: Introduce "soft warnings" and best-practice recommendations.
Full ISBP Library Integration: Deepen the rule-based engine for enhanced credibility.
Enhanced Usability: Add features like Excel exports, dashboards, and templates to increase stickiness.

Technical Considerations
Technology Preferences
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Frontend: React
Core Technology: OCR + LLM-supplemented Rules Engine
Language Support: English + Bangla
⚠️ Small Risks & Guardrails
Concurrency bottlenecks (FastAPI + Python): fine for 1k SMEs, but under 10k+ concurrent checks → add async workers.
OCR costs: could eat margins at high scale → hybrid OCR strategy later.
LLM dependency (cost + API reliance): fine for MVP, but OSS plan is critical for sustainability.
SME UX: must be ultra-simple → resist feature creep before nailing upload → report flow.

Constraints & Assumptions
Constraints
Budget & Resources: Bootstrapped by a solo founder, requiring extreme capital efficiency.
Timeline: An 8-10 week target for the MVP launch.
Audience: SMEs only for the MVP.
Key Assumptions & Impact Analysis
Market Assumption (Highest Risk): That SMEs will pay for this service. If false, the business model breaks. Mitigate by testing pricing early and exploring channel partnerships.
Technical Assumption: That OCR will be accurate enough. If false, trust is eroded. Mitigate with a manual correction mode and transparent confidence scores.
Trust Assumption: That SMEs/banks will respect an AI report. If false, adoption flatlines. Mitigate by citing official rules in every flag and co-designing the "Bank View" PDF with officers.

Risks & Open Questions
Open Questions (Prioritized)
Market Viability: What is the optimal price point that SMEs will actually pay?
Technical Accuracy: What is the real-world accuracy of the engine on messy documents?
Credibility: What report format will bank officers find most useful and trustworthy?
Usability: Is the core UI flow simple enough for non-technical users?
Areas Needing Further Research (Phased Validation Plan)
The immediate actions are to run the de-risking experiments to answer the open questions in priority order: first pricing tests, then accuracy benchmarking, then bank interviews, and finally usability tests.
