**Internal Gap Impact:** 9% of pilot readiness score
**Critical Path:** Database hardening must complete before load testing

## Priority Matrix

### P0 - Critical for Bank Pilots (Must Complete)
1. **Database Pooling & SSL** - Blocks bank-scale load handling
2. **Object Storage Migration** - Required for large document archive
3. **Load Testing** - Must validate performance before pilots
4. **UCP600 AI Integration** - Core value proposition for banks

### P1 - Important for Competitive Advantage
1. **LLM Discrepancy Analysis** - Differentiates from manual services
2. **Multilingual Support** - Critical for Bangladesh market
3. **Penetration Testing** - Required for bank security approval

### P2 - Future Enhancement
1. **Bank API Connectors** - Enables real-time integration
2. **eUCP 2.1 Support** - Future regulatory requirement

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Gaps
- **AI Integration:** Complex, unproven technology in banking compliance
- **Bank Partnerships:** Long sales cycles, regulatory approval needed
- **Multilingual AI:** Limited Bangla language model capabilities

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Parallel Development:** Start AI work while completing infrastructure
- **Bank Engagement:** Early pilot discussions and requirements gathering
- **Fallback Plans:** English-only MVP if Bangla AI quality insufficient

## Weekly Status Review Process

### Every Friday 3 PM (Asia/Dhaka)
1. **Review Progress:** Update status for each gap
2. **Identify Blockers:** Surface dependencies and issues
3. **Adjust Timeline:** Modify dates based on actual progress
4. **Resource Allocation:** Assign owners for unassigned gaps
5. **Risk Assessment:** Update risk ratings based on new information

### Monthly Pilot Readiness Review
- **Score Recalculation:** Update overall readiness percentage
