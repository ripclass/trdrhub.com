## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: Multi-Technology Integration Complexity

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex coordination between 5+ technologies
**Impact**: High - Foundation failure affects entire project
**Mitigation**:
- Add integration testing between all major components
- Create comprehensive testing matrix for technology interactions
- Implement staged deployment with rollback capabilities
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests for Turborepo + React + FastAPI + AWS CDK

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Integration test matrix covering all technology combinations
- End-to-end deployment pipeline testing
- Rollback and recovery procedure testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- AWS credentials security testing
- Lambda performance and cold start testing
- Infrastructure security scanning

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- CDK drift detection testing
- CI/CD pipeline resilience testing
- Font rendering compatibility testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting security/performance

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring in place
- Low risks with documented workarounds

### Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Lambda cold start metrics
- CI/CD pipeline success rates
- AWS resource costs and utilization
- Security scanning alerts
