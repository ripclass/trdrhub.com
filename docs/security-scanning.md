# Security Scanning Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive security scanning strategy implemented in the CI/CD pipeline to address the security gaps identified in the QA review.

## Overview

The security scanning strategy includes multiple layers of security testing to ensure comprehensive coverage:

1. **Static Code Analysis** - Vulnerability scanning of source code and dependencies
2. **Secret Detection** - Preventing accidental commit of sensitive information
3. **Dynamic Security Testing** - Runtime security testing with OWASP ZAP
4. **Dependency Scanning** - Monitoring for known vulnerabilities in third-party packages

## Security Tools Implemented

### 1. Trivy - Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanner

**Purpose:** Scans for vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure.

**Configuration:**
- Scans entire filesystem for vulnerabilities
- Outputs results in SARIF format for GitHub Security tab integration
- Runs on every push and pull request

**Coverage:**
- Known CVEs in dependencies
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) misconfigurations
- Container image vulnerabilities
- License compliance issues

### 2. Snyk - Dependency Vulnerability Management

**Purpose:** Monitors and fixes vulnerabilities in open source dependencies.

**Configuration:**
- Configured via `.snyk` policy file
- Fails build on high-severity vulnerabilities
- Excludes development dependencies from production scans
- Integrates with GitHub for automated pull requests

**Features:**
- Real-time vulnerability database
- Automated fix suggestions
- License compliance monitoring
- Container image scanning

### 3. GitLeaks - Secret Detection

**Purpose:** Prevents accidental exposure of secrets, API keys, and credentials.

**Configuration:**
- Scans entire git history
- Runs on every commit and pull request
- Configurable rules for different types of secrets

**Detection Capabilities:**
- API keys and tokens
- Database credentials
- Private keys and certificates
- Cloud provider credentials
- Generic password patterns

### 4. OWASP ZAP - Dynamic Application Security Testing

**Purpose:** Performs runtime security testing against running applications.

**Configuration:**
- Configured via `.zap/rules.tsv`
- Runs baseline security scan
- Categorizes findings by severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Generates HTML reports for review

**Test Coverage:**
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Authentication bypass
- Session management flaws
- Security header analysis

### 5. Bandit - Python Security Linter

**Purpose:** Identifies common security issues in Python code.

**Configuration:**
- Configured via `.bandit` file
- Scans all Python source code
- Excludes test directories and virtual environments
- Generates JSON reports for CI integration

**Detection Areas:**
- Hard-coded passwords
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Shell injection risks
- Insecure random number generation
- Unsafe deserialization

## CI/CD Integration

### Security Scanning Workflow

1. **Pre-deployment Security Gate**
   - All security scans must pass before deployment
   - High-severity vulnerabilities fail the build
   - Medium-severity issues generate warnings
   - Low-severity findings are informational

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Security scans run in parallel with unit tests
   - Reduces overall pipeline execution time
   - Early feedback on security issues

3. **Results Integration**
   - SARIF results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
   - Artifacts preserved for manual review
   - Integration with GitHub Advanced Security features

### Failure Handling

**High Severity Issues:**
- Fail the build immediately
- Block deployment to production
- Require manual review and remediation

**Medium Severity Issues:**
- Generate warnings in PR comments
- Allow deployment with approval
- Create tracking issues for remediation

**Low Severity Issues:**
- Log for informational purposes
- Include in security reports
- Address during regular maintenance

## Security Configuration Files

### `.snyk` - Snyk Policy Configuration
- Defines vulnerability ignore rules with justifications
- Configures language-specific settings
- Manages patch applications

### `.zap/rules.tsv` - OWASP ZAP Rules
- Defines severity thresholds for different vulnerability types
- Configures pass/fail criteria
- Maps security rules to business requirements

### `.bandit` - Python Security Configuration
- Excludes test directories from scanning
- Configures confidence and severity levels
- Defines output formats and reporting options

## Required Secrets Configuration

The following secrets must be configured in GitHub repository settings:

### Security Tool Tokens
- `SNYK_TOKEN` - Snyk authentication token
- `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` - GitLeaks license key (if using pro features)

### AWS Deployment Credentials
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS access key for CDK deployment
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret key for CDK deployment
- `AWS_REGION` - Target AWS region for deployment

### Vercel Deployment
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Vercel authentication token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Vercel project ID

### Application Endpoints
- `API_HEALTH_ENDPOINT` - Backend health check URL
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Frontend application URL

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Security Dashboards
- GitHub Security tab for vulnerability overview
- Snyk dashboard for dependency monitoring
- Custom security metrics in CI/CD pipeline

### Regular Security Reviews
- Weekly security scan result reviews
- Monthly security posture assessments
- Quarterly security tool configuration updates

### Incident Response
- Automated alerts for critical vulnerabilities
- Escalation procedures for security failures
- Documentation of remediation actions

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Run security scans locally before pushing
2. Review security findings in pull requests
3. Address high-severity issues immediately
4. Document security decisions and exceptions

### Dependency Management
1. Regularly update dependencies
2. Review security advisories for used packages
3. Use Snyk automated fix pull requests
4. Maintain an inventory of third-party components

### Secret Management
1. Never commit secrets to version control
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Rotate secrets regularly
4. Use AWS Secrets Manager for production secrets

## Compliance and Governance

### Security Standards
- Follows OWASP Top 10 security risks
- Implements security-by-design principles
- Maintains security documentation

### Audit Trail
- All security scan results are preserved
- Security decisions are documented
- Compliance reports generated monthly

This comprehensive security scanning strategy ensures that the identified security gaps from the QA review are thoroughly addressed, providing multiple layers of security testing throughout the development and deployment pipeline.
