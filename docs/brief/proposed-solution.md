# Proposed Solution

## The MVP: A Focused "Shield" for Day 1

The LCopilot MVP is a SaaS-based AI assistant designed to provide immediate, tangible risk reduction for SMEs. By simply uploading their documents, users receive an instant validation report flagging the most common and costly discrepancies before submission to the bank. The essential features for Day 1 are:

- **Upload & OCR**: Accept an LC plus 1â€“2 key documents (Invoice, Bill of Lading).
- **Rules-First Checks (Core Set)**: Focus on the "fatal four" discrepancies: Dates, amounts, parties, and ports.
- **Simple Cross-Check Matrix (v1)**: Provide a side-by-side field comparison of the core documents.
- **Bank-Ready Report (v1)**: Generate a clear discrepancy summary, checklist, and deadline tracker as a downloadable PDF.

## The Long-Term Vision

The long-term vision is for LCopilot to evolve from a defensive "shield" into a proactive "sword" for SMEs. It will become a holistic trade confidence platform that not only prevents errors but actively helps users optimize their trade cycles. The goal is to make LCopilot the indispensable digital co-pilot for every SME in Bangladesh engaged in international trade, making compliance a source of competitive advantage.
