# MVP Scope

## Core Features (Must-Have for v1)

- **Document Ingestion**: Upload LC, Commercial Invoice, and Bill of Lading (BL/AWB).
- **Core Rules Engine**: Checks for the "fatal four": Dates, Amounts, Parties, and Ports.
- **Simple Cross-Check Matrix**: Side-by-side comparison of key fields across uploaded documents.
- **Bank-Ready Report**: Downloadable PDF with a Discrepancy Summary, Document Checklist, and deadlines.
- **Basic UI Flow**: A simple, linear journey: Upload docs -> View issues -> Download report.

## Out of Scope for MVP

Complex advisory insights, full ISBP library coverage, advanced document matching (Insurance, Certs), holiday calendars, and advanced usability features (Excel exports, dashboards).

## MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful when we have validated that:

- **Accuracy is Validated**: The engine meets our internal accuracy benchmarks.
- **Trust is Established**: Pilot users report feeling more confident and in control.
- **Value is Confirmed**: A target percentage of users convert from free to paid.

**Note**: The MVP is optimized for exporters first; full importer support is planned for a post-MVP release.
