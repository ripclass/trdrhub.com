# Post-MVP Vision

## Prioritized Roadmap

- **Expanded Document Coverage**: Add validation for Insurance, Certificates of Origin, and Packing Lists to make the tool "complete" for exporters.
- **Importer-Focused Features**: Build out checks for Incoterms and other clauses critical to the importer journey, doubling the addressable market.
- **Advisory Layer**: Introduce "soft warnings" and best-practice recommendations.
- **Full ISBP Library Integration**: Deepen the rule-based engine for enhanced credibility.
- **Enhanced Usability**: Add features like Excel exports, dashboards, and templates to increase stickiness.
