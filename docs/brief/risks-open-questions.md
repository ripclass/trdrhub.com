# Risks & Open Questions

## Open Questions (Prioritized)

- **Market Viability**: What is the optimal price point that SMEs will actually pay?
- **Technical Accuracy**: What is the real-world accuracy of the engine on messy documents?
- **Credibility**: What report format will bank officers find most useful and trustworthy?
- **Usability**: Is the core UI flow simple enough for non-technical users?

## Areas Needing Further Research (Phased Validation Plan)

The immediate actions are to run the de-risking experiments to answer the open questions in priority order: first pricing tests, then accuracy benchmarking, then bank interviews, and finally usability tests.
