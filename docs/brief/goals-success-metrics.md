# Goals & Success Metrics

## Business Objectives

- **Launch MVP**: Launch the LCopilot MVP within 8-10 weeks to validate core product assumptions.
- **Validate Business Model**: Test SME willingness-to-pay by converting a target percentage of free-trial users to a paid plan.
- **Achieve Market Traction**: Onboard an initial cohort of SMEs to generate usage data and testimonials.

## User Success Metrics

- **Time-to-Confidence**: A drastic reduction in the time it takes a user to validate an LC (from hours/days to minutes).
- **Reduced Rejection Rate**: A measurable decrease in first-presentation document rejections, as reported by pilot users.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Activation Rate**: Number of users who complete their first free LC check.
- **Conversion Rate**: % of activated users who purchase a second check or a monthly pack.
- **Core Engine Accuracy**: Achieve a target precision/recall score on our internal "Accuracy Harness."

## Counter-Metrics (Early Warning Signals)

- **High Drop-off After Upload**: Users upload but don't generate a report (signals UX friction or lack of trust).
- **Low Second-Use Rate**: High percentage of users only use the free trial (signals low perceived value).
- **High Support Dependency**: High volume of "What does this mean?" tickets (signals report is not clear enough).
