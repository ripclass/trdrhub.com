# Constraints & Assumptions

## Constraints

- **Budget & Resources**: Bootstrapped by a solo founder, requiring extreme capital efficiency.
- **Timeline**: An 8-10 week target for the MVP launch.
- **Audience**: SMEs only for the MVP.

## Key Assumptions & Impact Analysis

- **Market Assumption (Highest Risk)**: That SMEs will pay for this service. If false, the business model breaks. Mitigate by testing pricing early and exploring channel partnerships.
- **Technical Assumption**: That OCR will be accurate enough. If false, trust is eroded. Mitigate with a manual correction mode and transparent confidence scores.
- **Trust Assumption**: That SMEs/banks will respect an AI report. If false, adoption flatlines. Mitigate by citing official rules in every flag and co-designing the "Bank View" PDF with officers.
