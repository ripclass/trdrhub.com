# Target Users

## Primary User Segment: The Bangladeshi SME Exporter/Importer

Our primary user is the owner or operations manager of an SME in Bangladesh's export/import sector (e.g., garments, seafood, jute).

- **Profile**: Typically employs 20-200 people and lacks a dedicated trade finance or legal department. LC validation is a high-stress, manual task handled by non-specialists.
- **Needs & Pains**: Their core need is certainty. Their primary pains are the fear of rejection, the financial hit from fees and delays, and a feeling of being powerless against complex rules.
- **Goals**: To get paid quickly and predictably (exporters) and ensure terms are correct from the start to avoid amendments (importers).

## User Journeys (Before vs. After)

- **Exporter's Journey**: Transforms from a multi-day, high-anxiety process of manual checks and waiting for bank feedback into a 15-minute, high-confidence process of uploading, fixing flagged issues, and submitting a compliant report.
- **Importer's Journey**: Transforms from a reactive process of discovering problematic LC terms after issuance (leading to costly amendments and supplier friction) into a proactive one of validating draft LCs before they are finalized, ensuring smoother transactions.

**Note**: The MVP is optimized to solve the primary pain points of exporters. While importers will find value in the core checks, full feature support for the importer journey is planned for a post-MVP release.
