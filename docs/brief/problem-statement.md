# Problem Statement

## The Current State: High Stakes, Manual Processes

For Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) exporters in Bangladesh, every shipment is a high-stakes event where cash flow is tied to perfect paperwork. The current process for validating a Letter of Credit (LC) is manual, fragmented, and fraught with anxiety. SMEs rely on a combination of self-checks by non-expert staff, expensive third-party consultants, or a slow feedback loop from their bankâ€”often discovering critical errors only after documents have been submitted and rejected. This creates a state of persistent uncertainty and operational friction.

"On my last shipment," says a Chittagong-based exporter of frozen seafood, "the bank found a mismatch between the invoice and the LC for the port name. It delayed my payment for 19 days. Every day my container sat at the port, I was paying demurrage. By the time I got paid, I had lost half the profit."

## Quantifiable Impact: A Drain on SME Resources

A single discrepancy in an LC presentation is enough for a bank to refuse payment, triggering a cascade of direct and indirect costs that disproportionately harm SMEs:

- **Payment Delays**: Cash flow, the lifeblood of an SME, is frozen for days or weeks.
- **Direct Fees**: Banks charge significant fees for handling discrepancies and re-presenting documents.
- **Demurrage & Storage Costs**: Delays at the port result in daily fees that erode profit margins.
- **Reputational Damage**: Failed presentations damage trust with international buyers and financial institutions.

## Why Existing Solutions Fail

Current workarounds are inadequate for the SME segment:

- **Manual Checklists**: Prone to human error and unable to handle the complexity of cross-document consistency checks required by UCP 600/ISBP standards.
- **Consultants & Agents**: Expensive, dependency-creating, and not available on-demand for the instant feedback modern trade requires.
- **Bank Pre-Checks**: Slow, not guaranteed, and position the bank as an auditor rather than a partner.

## The Urgency for SMEs

In a competitive global market, the speed and reliability of payment cycles are a significant competitive advantage. The manual process is a major bottleneck that stifles growth, introduces unnecessary financial risk, and consumes valuable time that SME owners should be spending on expanding their business, not firefighting paperwork.
