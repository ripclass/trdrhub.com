# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for LCopilot, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This is a greenfield project with a specified FastAPI (Python) backend and React frontend. To accelerate setup and enforce consistency, the following approach will be used:

- **Monorepo Tool**: Use Turborepo for a high-performance build system.
- **Frontend Starter**: Initialize using the standard Vite + React (TypeScript) template.
- **Backend Structure**: Use a standard, community-accepted FastAPI project structure.
