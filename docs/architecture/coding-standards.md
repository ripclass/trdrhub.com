# Coding Standards

Standards will be enforced automatically via linters (ESLint, Flake8), formatters (Prettier, Black), pre-commit hooks (Husky), and CI pipeline checks. Key architectural rules, such as using the packages/shared-types and the centralized API client, will be enforced with custom linting rules where possible.
