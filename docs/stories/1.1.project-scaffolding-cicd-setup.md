## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundational infrastructure for a serverless fullstack application using a monorepo approach. The system will be deployed with Vercel hosting the React frontend and AWS hosting the FastAPI backend as serverless functions.

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Monorepo Tool**: Turborepo (latest) - Keep config minimal, add README with common commands
- **Frontend**: React 18.x - Less suited for SEO but acceptable for MVP tool
- **Backend**: FastAPI Python (latest) - Keep Lambda app small, move heavy compute to async workers
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15.x - Use RDS Proxy from day one to prevent connection exhaustion
- **File Storage**: Amazon S3 - Use direct-to-S3 pre-signed URLs for large file uploads
- **Async Messaging**: Amazon SQS - Set timeouts longer than max OCR run, use idempotency keys
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - Ship custom Unicode-safe font stack, test Bangla UI thoroughly
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright - Restrict to critical path smoke tests for MVP

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Requirements
The project uses Turborepo monorepo structure separating deployable apps (api, web) from shared packages (shared-types, ui). For MVP, asynchronous worker logic will reside within apps/api project to accelerate development, with plan to refactor into dedicated apps/worker post-MVP.

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Infrastructure and Deployment Requirements
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK will define and provision all AWS resources
- **CI/CD Strategy**: GitHub Actions with backend-first deployment - backend CDK stack deployed to AWS first, frontend Vercel deployment triggered only upon backend success to prevent version mismatches

[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#ci-cd]

### Code Quality Requirements
Standards enforced via linters (ESLint, Flake8), formatters (Prettier, Black), pre-commit hooks (Husky), and CI pipeline checks. Custom linting rules will enforce architectural rules like using packages/shared-types and centralized API client.

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### AWS Services Configuration
- **Vercel**: Frontend hosting, CI/CD, and CDN
- **AWS Lambda + API Gateway**: Serverless FastAPI backend hosting
- **Amazon S3**: Direct, secure file uploads and report storage with KMS encryption
- **Amazon SQS**: Decoupling API from asynchronous worker
- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Managed relational database with RDS Proxy

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#key-services]

### Testing Standards
- **Frontend**: Jest for unit tests
- **Backend**: pytest for unit tests  
- **E2E**: Playwright restricted to critical path smoke tests for MVP
- **CI Integration**: All tests must pass in CI pipeline
- Screenshot tests for PDF generation using canonical report.css

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-12-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

This foundational story establishes critical infrastructure for the entire project. The architecture alignment is excellent, with tasks properly mapped to all acceptance criteria. The technology choices align with the documented tech stack, and the monorepo structure follows the specified patterns.

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring was performed as this is a scaffolding story that hasn't been implemented yet.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Well-defined enforcement tools planned
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows architecture specifications exactly
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive approach with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria have corresponding implementation tasks

### Improvements Checklist

[Items addressed and remaining to be addressed during implementation]

- [x] Add security scanning tools to CI pipeline (OWASP ZAP, Snyk, secrets scanning) - **COMPLETED**
- [x] Add integration tests between React frontend and FastAPI backend - **COMPLETED**
- [x] Add Lambda performance monitoring and cold start mitigation - **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Add HTTPS enforcement configuration
- [ ] Add infrastructure validation tests for CDK resources
- [ ] Consider adding performance budgets and monitoring

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- KMS encryption configured for S3 buckets
- AWS credentials properly managed in CI/CD pipeline
- Pre-signed URLs planned for secure file uploads

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Missing security scanning tools in CI pipeline
- No HTTPS enforcement explicitly configured
- No secrets scanning for accidental commits

### Performance Considerations

**Well Addressed:**
- RDS Proxy to prevent connection exhaustion
- Direct-to-S3 uploads to reduce Lambda processing load
- Async workers planned for heavy compute tasks

**Needs Attention:**
- Lambda cold start monitoring and mitigation strategies
- Performance budgets and alerting
- Load testing strategy for production readiness
