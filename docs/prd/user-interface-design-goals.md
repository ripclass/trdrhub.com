# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience must embody the core value proposition: transforming the user's journey from fear and uncertainty to clarity, confidence, and control. The UI should be minimalist, professional, and function-first.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Linear Workflow**: The MVP will enforce a strict workflow: Welcome → Upload → Review → Report.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: The system will present a high-level summary first, allowing users to drill down into details to avoid overwhelm.

## Core Screens and Views (MVP)

- **Welcome / Onboarding Screen**: A screen to frame the tool, set expectations, provide a sample LC pack, and display privacy reassurances before upload.
- **Upload Screen**: A simple, clear interface to upload the required documents.
- **Review Screen**: A unified view presenting the discrepancy summary and the detailed Cross-Check Matrix.
- **Report View**: A simple preview of the final PDF report with a prominent "Download" button.

## Accessibility & Branding

- **Accessibility**: The application should meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
- **Branding**: The UI will be clean, professional, and use a simple color palette (Green/Red/Yellow) to convey status instantly.
