## Product Quality Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Acceptance

#### Given-When-Then Scenarios

**Scenario 1: SME Document Validation**
```gherkin
Given an SME user uploads a valid LC document
When the system processes the document
Then validation results are available within 10 seconds
And discrepancies are clearly explained in user's language
And a downloadable compliance report is generated
And the validation accuracy exceeds 95%
```

**Scenario 2: Bank Pilot Integration**
```gherkin
Given a bank pilot partner
When they access the system through whitelisted IP
When they authenticate with mTLS certificates
Then they can process documents for their customers
And all actions are logged in immutable audit trail
And data isolation is maintained between tenants
```

**Scenario 3: AI-Assisted Validation**
```gherkin
Given a complex LC scenario beyond deterministic rules
When the AI assistance layer processes the document
Then professional explanations are generated
And banking terminology is appropriate for audience
And no hallucinated rules are introduced
And expert review is triggered for edge cases
```
