# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

**For Users**: To drastically reduce the time and anxiety involved in validating Letters of Credit, eliminate costly errors, and accelerate payment cycles.

**For the Business**: To successfully launch a focused MVP within 8-10 weeks to validate the core assumption that Bangladeshi SMEs will pay for a specialized, AI-powered compliance tool.

## Background Context

SMEs in Bangladesh's export sector currently rely on slow, expensive, and error-prone manual processes to validate Letters of Credit. A single discrepancy can lead to payment rejections, shipment delays, and significant fees, directly impacting their cash flow and profitability. LCopilot addresses this by providing an instant, accurate, and automated validation service that transforms compliance from a business risk into a source of confidence.

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP)

- **Enterprise/Banks**: Features tailored for banks or large corporations (e.g., integration into trade finance systems, enterprise dashboards).
- **Advanced Document Types**: Validation of secondary docs such as insurance, certificates of origin, packing lists.
- **Full ISBP Coverage**: Comprehensive rule library beyond the "fatal four."
- **Advisory Intelligence**: "Soft warning" insights, recommendations, or optimization suggestions.
- **Complex Integrations**: No external integrations with freight forwarders, customs agents, or ERP systems.
- **Mobile App**: Fully native iOS/Android apps are out of scope; MVP is responsive web only.
