# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will be structured as a Monorepo to maximize development speed and simplify dependency management.

## Service Architecture: Monolith

The backend will be developed as a single, monolithic service for the MVP to reduce deployment complexity.

## Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid

The project will adhere to a full testing pyramid (Unit, Integration, and E2E tests) to ensure quality.

## Risks Associated with Technical Assumptions

- **Monorepo**: Risk of slower CI/CD pipelines as the codebase grows. Mitigated by using lightweight tools like Turborepo.
- **Monolith**: Risk of difficulty in scaling specific bottlenecks. Mitigated by designing with decoupled internal modules.
- **Full Testing Pyramid**: Risk of E2E tests being time-consuming. Mitigated by prioritizing only the critical user flow for E2E testing in the MVP.
- **Dual-OCR Strategy**: Risk of high costs and latency. Mitigated by caching results and allowing user overrides.
- **LLM for Summaries**: Risk of misaligned user expectations. Mitigated by explicitly tagging outputs as "Rule-based check" vs. "AI advisory."
