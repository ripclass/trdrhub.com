## Revenue Optimization & Billing Models

### Dual Billing Protection in Marketplace

Our marketplace must maintain the **critical dual billing model** that protects LCopilot's core revenue:

#### SME Customer Billing (Primary Revenue)
```
Base Validation: $5 - $12 per document
├── Standard Tier: $5 per validation
├── Premium Tier: $8 per validation
└── Enterprise Tier: $12 per validation

Integration Usage: $1 - $20 per API call
├── Customs Submission: $10 - $15
├── Logistics Quote: $3 - $8
├── FX Quote: $2 - $5
└── Insurance Quote: $5 - $12
```

#### Bank Customer Billing (Secondary Revenue)
```
LC Recheck: $15 - $40 per validation
├── Standard Tier: $15 per recheck
├── Premium Tier: $25 per recheck
└── Enterprise Tier: $40 per recheck

CRITICAL: Banks cannot reuse SME validations
Billing Guard enforces 402 Payment Required
```

#### Partner Revenue Share Models

**Model 1: Fixed Percentage (Recommended)**
```
Partner receives % of integration fees only
SME validation fees: 100% retained by LCopilot
Bank recheck fees: 100% retained by LCopilot
Integration fees: Split with partner

Example:
├── SME pays $10 customs submission → $8 LCopilot, $2 Partner
├── Bank pays $25 LC recheck → $25 LCopilot, $0 Partner
└── Total: $33 LCopilot, $2 Partner (94% vs 6%)
```

**Model 2: Tiered Revenue Share**
```
Volume-based scaling:
├── 0-1,000 calls/month: 90% LCopilot / 10% Partner
├── 1,001-5,000 calls/month: 85% LCopilot / 15% Partner
├── 5,001-10,000 calls/month: 80% LCopilot / 20% Partner
└── 10,000+ calls/month: 75% LCopilot / 25% Partner
```

**Model 3: Value-Added Services**
```
Base integration: Standard revenue share
Premium features: Higher partner percentage
├── Real-time tracking: +5% partner share
├── Advanced analytics: +3% partner share
├── White-label options: +10% partner share
└── Custom development: Negotiated rates
```

### Partner Billing Implementation

#### Technical Implementation
```python
class PartnerBillingCalculator:
    def calculate_partner_share(self, event: IntegrationBillingEvent) -> Decimal:
        # CRITICAL: Never share SME validation or bank recheck fees
        if event.event_type in [BillingEventType.SME_VALIDATION, BillingEventType.BANK_RECHECK]:
            return Decimal('0.00')

        # Only share integration-specific fees
        partner_config = self.get_partner_config(event.integration_id)
        base_share = event.charged_amount * partner_config.revenue_share_percentage

        # Apply volume bonuses
        volume_bonus = self.calculate_volume_bonus(event.company_id, event.integration_id)

        return base_share + volume_bonus
```

#### Revenue Protection Mechanisms
1. **Immutable Billing Events**: Partner shares calculated from permanent records
2. **Monthly Reconciliation**: Automated partner payout calculations
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete revenue sharing audit log
4. **Dispute Resolution**: Clear escalation process for billing disputes
