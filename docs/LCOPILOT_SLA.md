```

**Exclusions from Downtime**:
- Scheduled maintenance windows (with proper notice)
- Customer-caused outages
- Third-party service provider outages

**Throughput Measurement**:
```
Requests Per Minute = Total Successful Requests / Total Minutes in Measurement Period
```

### A.3 Credit Calculations
