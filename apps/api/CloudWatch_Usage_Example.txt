# CloudWatch Verification Usage Example

# Step 1: Trigger some errors
curl 'http://localhost:8000/debug/spam-errors?count=6'

# Step 2: Run verification script  
python3 verify_cloudwatch_full.py

# Expected output when working:
# ✅ Found X log events
# ✅ LCopilotErrorCount incremented by Y at timestamp
# 🎉 CloudWatch pipeline fully verified!

# Current output (since CloudWatch not fully connected):
# ❌ No logs found in last 5 min
# ❌ No datapoints for LCopilotErrorCount
# ⚠️ Partial verification failed — check setup.
