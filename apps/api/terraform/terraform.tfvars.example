# Terraform Variables Example for LCopilot CloudWatch Monitoring
# Copy to terraform.tfvars and customize for your environment

# Environment Configuration
environment = "prod"  # or "staging"
aws_region  = "eu-north-1"

# Alarm Configuration
alarm_threshold         = 5     # Number of errors to trigger alarm
alarm_period           = 60    # Period in seconds (1 minute)
alarm_evaluation_periods = 1    # Number of periods for evaluation

# Example configurations for different environments:

# Production Environment
# environment = "prod"
# alarm_threshold = 5
# alarm_period = 60

# Staging Environment
# environment = "staging"
# alarm_threshold = 3  # Lower threshold for staging
# alarm_period = 60
