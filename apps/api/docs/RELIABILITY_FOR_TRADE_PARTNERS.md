# LCopilot Reliability for Trade Partners
## Comprehensive UCP600/ISBP + Bangladesh Local Banking Rules Compliance

### Overview

LCopilot's Trust Platform provides comprehensive reliability validation for Letter of Credit (LC) operations, combining international ICC standards with locally relevant banking requirements. Our compliance engine validates against UCP600, ISBP, and common rejection scenarios from Bangladeshi banks, helping SMEs, traders, and banks prevent costly LC rejections.

### Why Local Compliance Matters

In addition to ICC's UCP600/ISBP rules, LCopilot validates against common rejection scenarios from Bangladeshi banks, such as:
- Beneficiary address mismatches (DBBL, Sonali Bank)
- HS code inconsistencies (Standard Chartered, HSBC)
- Currency errors across documents (Islami Bank, Mercantile Bank)
- Export permit inconsistencies (Janata Bank, Agrani Bank)
- Insurance coverage variations (Prime Bank, NCC Bank)

This prevents costly rejections at major banks including DBBL, Sonali, Islami Bank, Standard Chartered, BRAC Bank, and others.

## Bangladesh Local Banking Rules Coverage

#### 2. **BD-002: Currency Consistency (22% of rejections)**
- **Banks Enforcing:** Islami Bank, Mercantile Bank, Premier Bank
- **Issue:** Mixed currencies across documents (USD/BDT/EUR)
- **Prevention:** Validates currency consistency across all documents
- **Impact:** Critical - automatic dishonor

#### 3. **BD-003: HS Code Exact Matching (18% of rejections)**
- **Banks Enforcing:** Standard Chartered, HSBC, Citibank
- **Issue:** HS codes don't match exactly between LC and invoice
- **Prevention:** NBR customs requirements validation
- **Impact:** High - customs and bank rejection

#### 4. **BD-004: Partial Shipment Terms (15% of rejections)**

## Implementation Examples

### Python Integration
```python
from lcopilot import ComplianceClient

client = ComplianceClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Run comprehensive compliance check
result = client.validate_compliance(
    lc_reference="LC2024-BD-001",
    documents=[lc_doc, invoice_doc, bl_doc],
    check_types=["ucp600", "isbp", "bangladesh_local"],
    target_banks=["DBBL", "Sonali Bank", "Islami Bank"]
)

# Check overall compliance
print(f"Compliance Score: {result.compliance_score}%")
print(f"Rejection Risk: {result.rejection_risk}")

# Bangladesh-specific insights
if result.bangladesh_local.violations:
    print("Bangladesh Local Banking Issues:")
    for violation in result.bangladesh_local.violations:
        print(f"  {violation.rule}: {violation.description}")
        print(f"  Affects: {', '.join(violation.banks_affected)}")
        print(f"  Fix: {violation.suggested_fix}")

# Estimate cost impact
prevention = result.rejection_prevention
print(f"Estimated Cost Savings: ${prevention.estimated_cost_savings:,}")
print(f"Prevented Delays: {prevention.prevented_delays_days} days")
```

### Node.js Integration
```javascript
const { LCopilotClient } = require('lcopilot-sdk');

const client = new LCopilotClient({
  apiKey: process.env.LCOPILOT_API_KEY
});

async function validateWithBangladeshRules(lcData) {
  try {
    const result = await client.compliance.validate({
      lcReference: lcData.reference,
      documents: lcData.documents,
      checkTypes: ['ucp600', 'isbp', 'bangladesh_local'],
      targetBanks: ['DBBL', 'Sonali Bank', 'Islami Bank']
    });

    // Analyze Bangladesh-specific risks
    const bdRisks = result.bangladeshLocal.violations.filter(
      v => v.severity === 'high'
    );

    if (bdRisks.length > 0) {
      console.log('High-risk Bangladesh banking issues found:');
      bdRisks.forEach(risk => {
        console.log(`- ${risk.description} (${risk.rule})`);
        console.log(`  Banks affected: ${risk.banksAffected.join(', ')}`);
        console.log(`  Suggested fix: ${risk.suggestedFix}`);
      });
    }

    return {
      compliant: result.overallResult === 'pass',
      score: result.complianceScore,
      rejectionRisk: result.rejectionRisk,
      costSavings: result.rejectionPrevention.estimatedCostSavings
    };

  } catch (error) {
