## Frequently Asked Questions

### For SMEs

**Q: Which bank should I test with for maximum compliance assurance?**
A: Test with state-owned banks (Sonali, Janata) first. If your LC passes their hyper-conservative validation, it will likely pass at any bank.

**Q: Why do I get different compliance scores for the same LC?**
A: Different banks have different enforcement levels. A score of 85% with HSBC (very strict) might be 92% with BRAC Bank (moderate) for the same document.

**Q: Can I test with multiple banks at once?**
A: Currently, select one bank per validation. We recommend testing with your target bank first, then with a conservative bank for assurance.

### For Banks

**Q: How accurate are the enforcement profiles?**
A: Profiles are based on publicly available information and industry knowledge. Banks can request updates to ensure accuracy.

**Q: How often are profiles updated?**
A: Profiles are reviewed quarterly and updated as needed based on bank feedback and regulatory changes.

**Q: Can we get a private/custom profile?**
A: Yes, enterprise banks can request custom profiles with specific enforcement parameters and private validation logic.
